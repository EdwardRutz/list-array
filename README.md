# List-Array: Ruby Planet Array



## Reference

* [Ruby Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/Array.html)
- Sun:  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto

## Exercise

- [X] Use `append()` to add Jupiter and Saturn at the end of the array.
- [X] Use the `concat()` method to add another array of the last two planets in our solar system to the end of the array.
- [X] Use `insert()` to add Earth, and Venus in the correct order.
- [X] Use `append()` again to add Pluto to the end of the array.
- [X] Now that all the planets are in the array, slice the array in order to get the rocky planets into a new list called `rocky_planets`.
- [X] Being good amateur astronomers, we know that Pluto is now a dwarf planet, so use the `pop` operation to remove it from the end of `planet_list`.

## Iterating over planets

- [X] Create another array containing arrays where each array will hold the name of a spacecraft that we have launched, and the names of the planet(s) that it has visited, or landed on. (e.g. `['Cassini', 'Saturn']`).

- [ ] Iterate over your array of planets, and inside that loop, iterate over the array of arrays. Print, for each planet, which satellites have visited.
